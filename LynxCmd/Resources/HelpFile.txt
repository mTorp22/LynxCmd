Give me 2 / 3 parameters
1: Ip Address of TLX/FLX 
2: Command 
3: -q OPTIONAL, for quiet mode, only value + suffix is output e.g "LynxCmd.exe 192.168.0.2  ProductionToday -q" will return 23 kWh
Commands are:
TotalProduction - Total produced kWh over inverter lifetime
EnergyNow - Instant feed in power (Combined L1, L2,L3)
EnergyL1 - Instant L1 power in W
EnergyL2 - Instant L2 power in W
EnergyL3 - Instant L2 power in W
CurrentL1 - Instant L1 current in A
CurrentL2 - Instant L2 current in A
CurrentL3 - Instant L3 current in A
ProductionToday - kWh produced today (until now)
ProductionThisWeek - kWh produced this week
ProductionLastWeek - kWh produced last week
ProductionThisMonth - kWh produced in this month
ProductionLastMonth - kWh produced last month
ProductionThisYear - kWh produced in this year
ProductionLastYear - kWh produced last year
Opmode - request TLX / FLX operationel status
GridFreq - Grid frequency, mean, phase L1, L2 & L3
GridVoltL1 - Mean grid voltage L1, over 10 minutes
GridVoltL2 - Mean grid voltage L2, over 10 minutes
GridVoltL3 - Mean grid voltage L3, over 10 minutes
